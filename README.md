# learning-from-data-hw
self-study work for caltech's cs156 machine learning course

- hw1: Basic Probabiliy and Perceptron Learning Algorithm **DONE**
  - perceptron learning algo coded in pla.py
  - problem-specific classes and definitions in hw1_pla.py
  - actual function calling in hw1.py
- hw2: Hoeffding Inequality, Error and Noise, Linear Regression, Nonlinear Transformations **DONE**
  - testing hoeffding inequality with simulated coin flips in hw2_hoeffding.py
